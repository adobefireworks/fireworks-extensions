Installation
============

  1. Open "\Users\Cohen\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Fireworks CS5\Commands"
  2. Create folder "Martin Cohen"
  3. Put the *.jsf files to the folder
  
Optionally you can also assign the shortcut:

  1. In Fireworks go to Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts > Commands > Martin Cohen > &lt;Name of the command&gt;
  2. Change the shortcut. 

Smart Duplicate
===============

Duplicates current selection in-place and also duplicates slices with names with `_d` suffix.

I've mapped this to Ctrl+D.
