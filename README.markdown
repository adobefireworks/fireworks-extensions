Installation
============

  1. Open "\Users\Cohen\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Fireworks CS5\Commands"
  2. Create folder "Martin Cohen"
  3. Put the *.jsf files to the folder
  
Optionally you can also assign the shortcut:

  2. Change the shortcut. 

Smart Duplicate
===============

Duplicates current selection in-place and also duplicates slices with names with `_d` suffix.

I've mapped this to Ctrl+D.

Rename
======

Shows a dialog to change the name of currently selected element. It only works when one element is selected.

I've mapped this to F2. (Originally toggles the Layers window, but I don't use that)


Find Element
============

Asks for a name and tries to find elements with that name. All elements found matching the name will be selected.

I've mapped this to F3.
